# Cuvette Assembly Files
3D CAD files (Solidworks and STEP) and engineering drawings (PDF) for a custom watertight stainless steel cuvette used to evaluate fluorescence excitation efficiency with a water-immersion objective.

## Solidworks
To view the cuvette assembly in Solidworks, download and unzip cuvette_Solidworks.zip. Then open cuvette_assembled.sldasm. If you use a different CAD software or your Solidworks version is out of date, follow the instructions below to download and open STEP files.

## STEP
Download and unzip cuvette_STEP.zip. Then open cuvette_assembled.STEP to see fully assembled and exploded views of the assembly. Open all the other files to see the individual parts. All files are in STEP AP203 format for compatibility with various CAD software.

## Engineering Drawing PDFs
Engineering drawings of the two custom pieces in the cuvette assembly are provided as PDF files. Simply download and open cuvette_top.pdf and cuvette_bottom.pdf.
